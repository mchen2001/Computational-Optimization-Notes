# Basics

### Rank

_The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of its_ [_linearly independent column_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/linearly-independent-column) _vectors (or row vectors)._

It also can be shown that the columns (rows) of a [square matrix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/square-matrix) are linearly independent only if the matrix is nonsingular. In other words, the rank of any [nonsingular matrix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/nonsingular-matrix) of order _n_ is _n._

### Nonsingular Matrix

An $$n \times n$$ matrix $$A$$ is called _nonsingular_ or _invertible matrix_ if there exists an $$n \times n$$ matrix $$B$$ such that

$$
AB=BA=I.
$$

If $$A$$ does not have an inverse, $$A$$ is called _singular matrix_.

### **Orthogonal Matrices**

**Definition.** A matrix $$A$$ is **orthogonal** if $$A^TA=AA^T=I$$.

### Range

The [**range**](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ColumnSpace.html) (also called the [column space](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ColumnSpace.html) or image) of a $$m \times n$$ matrix $$A$$ is the span (set of all possible linear combinations) of its column vectors. The column space of a matrix is the image or range of the corresponding matrix transformation.
